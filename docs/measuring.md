## Editing your measurements

You can edit your measurements after you've drawn them by turning on either of the measurement tools (as described above). When you hover close to the edge of one of your measurements your mouse will snap to it and display 'Drag to modify'. Click and drag to edit the measurement, the measurement result will be updated as you make changes.

## Removing your measurements

You can delete your measurements by clicking on any of your existing measurements and clicking the 'Remove measurement' option (to remove just the measurement you clicked)
