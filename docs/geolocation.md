# Geolocation

You can use geolocation to track you, draw your route and download it as a GPX file to use in other applications.

When you select the geolocation button, you have some options to choose. If you're using your mobile phone you can choose to keep your screen awake as you're making your route (this may not work on some browsers). You can also choose if you want your route to draw on the map to be downloadable and how accurate you want the tracking to be.

When you are ready to begin, hit the start tracking button.

The map will zoom to your location and start drawing your route as you move.

## Having trouble finding your location?

Make sure you are in an area that can see the southern sky relatively clearly, without buildings or other obstructions in the way. 

You may have to choose a lower accuracy threshold in the tracking options if your device is struggling to get an accurate enough fix on your location.

If you continue to have issues, check your settings to make sure your location is as accurate as possible.
