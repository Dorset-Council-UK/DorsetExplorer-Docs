# Versions
DorsetExplorer has many different 'versions' for different uses. 

We have so many layers available that putting them all in one version would make it far too difficult to find what you wanted, so we've created a number of different versions each with their own use.

You can find and switch between different versions using the 'Change version' dropdown at the top of your map. This drop down will either show you:

- Featured versions
    - These are versions we think you might be interested in
- Your most recently visited versions
- A combination of the two

There wil also be a link to 'See all versions' which will list everything you can access and a brief description of what it is.
