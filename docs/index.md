# What is DorsetExplorer and what can I do with it?

DorsetExplorer is an easy to use web mapping application for members of the public and council staff. 

DorsetExplorer gives you access to a wealth of geographic information in and around Dorset. You can find nearly anything in one of our many versions covering:

* rights of way
* school catchments
* historic OS Basemaps from the late 1800s
* high resolution aerial photography from throughout the years
* digital terrain models 
* and much more

As well as seeing information laid out on a map, you can also:

  * Add your own drawings to the map using our powerful [annotations feature](./drawing.md)
  * Create PDF maps for [printing or sharing](./exporting-and-printing.md)
  * [Find addresses, coordinates, settlements and more](./searching.md)
  * [Measure](./measuring.md) features on the map
  * Use our [Geolocation](./geolocation.md) feature to track and log your real time position
