# Background maps

Background map settings can be accessed with the 'Background Map' button on the right.

In this panel, you'll be able to change the background map (sometimes referred to as a basemap) and set its transparency and saturation.

You can switch background maps simply by clicking on the relevant tile. A set of options appear underneath each background map allowing you to change its transparency (how see-through the map is) and saturation (how strong the colour is).

!!! note
    Some versions of DorsetExplorer may contain different background map options than what is displayed in the image above.

## Street View

Right-click (or long tap on a tablet or phone) on any road on the map, and choose 'Open Street View at this location'. This will open a new window and take you to the location you clicked on so you can explore further. If the location is not available in Street View, a message will tell you this.
