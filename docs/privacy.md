## Other logging

### Cloudflare Web Analytics

We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to gather aggregated information to understand how visitors engage with DorsetExplorer. Cloudflare Web Analytics is a privacy respecting analytics provider which doesn't set cookies or track you individually in any way. You can learn more on their website - [https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics/](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics/)

### ApplicationInsights

We use Microsoft ApplicationInsights to log usage and track errors. This cannot be used to identify you individually and is only used to monitor for issues and log searches and version usage at a high level.

### Web server logs

Our web servers, like all web servers, log requests and store them in a log file. This contains the URL you visited, how long it took to respond and your IP address. None of this can be tied to an individual and these are regularly deleted, and only used to gather high level statistics, investigate problems or spot abuse.

### Local Storage use

We use a feature of your browser called 'Local Storage' to keep track of whether you have seen the DorsetExplorer tour, when you last saw the 'welcome message' and keep track of any personalisation or preferences you've set. These are only stored in your browser and never sent to us. They are used by the application to show, hide or tweak the relevant parts of the site to be personal to you. This is what stops you from seeing a prompt to take the tour every single time you visit, and how it remembers your layer control sort order preference. These are controlled by you and can be deleted at any time, just search for your browser name and the term 'delete local storage'.
