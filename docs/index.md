# What is DorsetExplorer and what can I do with it?

DorsetExplorer is an easy to use web mapping application for members of the public and council staff. 

DorsetExplorer gives you access to a wealth of geographic information in and around Dorset. You can find nearly anything in our ever-expanding list of layers, including:

* rights of way
* school catchments
* historic OS Basemaps from the late 1800s
* high resolution aerial photography from throughout the years
* digital terrain models 
* and much more

As well as seeing information laid out on a map, you can create your own drawings to export and share.
